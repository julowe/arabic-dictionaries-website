# Arabic Dictionaries Website

Welcome.

This repository is a pared down version of
[this repository/website](https://github.com/abu-dju/abu-dju.github.io)
which tries to gather some rare and useful dictionaries that have fallen in
the public domain (for instance: Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon)

This is the file and code store for the website hosted through GitHub pages,
available at <https://julowe.github.io/arabic-dictionaries-website/>
