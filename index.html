    <p>
      Get an app that can load StarDict or mdict formatted files.
      I've tried these apps on iPhone, they may have Android equivalents,
      I haven't looked:

    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://xiaoyifang.github.io/goldendict-ng/install/">GoldenDict-ng</a> (for MacOS, Windows, and
        Linux) to be the best desktop dictionary application.
        It is the "next generation" of GoldenDict, which is no longer maintained.</li>
      <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dicty/id969045273" target="_blank">Dicty (for iPhone)</a> is a free
        dictionary app for iPhone that can load StarDict formatted files.
        Not sure about other formats.</li>
      <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictionary-universal/id312088272" target="_blank">Dictionary Universal
          (for iPhone)</a> is $6, but I got it because Dicty wasn't returning all the Sanskrit words
        when I typed them using English letters, and this app did.
        Not sure if it is worth it for Arabic dictionary files, try the free app first.
        This app does work well (in my limited testing) with Arabic dictionary files.</li>
    </ol>
    Then download the StarDict dictionary files from the <b><a href="dl.html#stardict">downloads</a></b> page,
    and load them into the app of your choice.

    </h3>
    <p>
      This site has useful Arabic dictionaries that have fallen in the public
      domain.
    </p>

    <!-- TODO: link to projects/repos -->
    <p>
      Lane's Lexicon has been made available as a machine readable format by
      the Perseus project and further enhanced by the Alpheios project.
    </p>

    Note from previous developer: There exist (to my knowledge) two android versions on the PlayStore:

    <ol>
      <li>Lane's Arabic Lexicon</li>
      <li>Muggy's DictBrowser.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      While the former is a paid app that does not even have an ad-version,
      the latter is available as a paid and an ad-supported app. Unfortunately
      there is no computer version for look-ups with free open-source software
      (except for the web versions -- perseus, alpheios)
    </p>

    </h3>

    <p>
      On this site, you will be able to download versions of these
      dictionaries in these open-formats:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Babylon (*.bgl)</li>
      <li>Comma-Separated-Value (*.csv)</li>
      <li>DictionaryForMIDs (DFM) (*.jar)</li>
      <li>Dictd (*.dict.dz)</li>
      <li>MDict (*.mdx | *.mdd)</li>
      <li>Aard2 Slob (*.slob)</li>
      <li>StarDict (*.ifo | *.idx | *.dict.dz)</li>
      <li>XDXF (*.xdxf)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Note that most (?) formats are created from the GoldenDict PC version.
      As for the Android version I am not sure.
